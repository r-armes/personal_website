                Hi there! My name is Reece Armes (you have probably guessed that by now), and I am a junior full-stack developer based in Melbourne, Australia. I am currently undertaking the Intensive Diploma of Information Technology at Coder Academy, and have been loving every minute of it! 
                I have always had a passion for design and problem solving which help me think of imaginative ways to produce new creations or innovative methods to accomplish jobs more efficiently. Being surrounded by creative minds from a young age, having multiple family members in the design industry, I have always admired their work which inspired me to want to design and develop creations of my own. After graduating secondary school, I decided to teach myself parts of the Adobe Suite, giving me the skills needed to create a diverse range of projects, including logos, posters, and flyers. In 2015, I completed a Certificate II in Creative Industries at AIE where I learnt the basics of Autodesk Maya and how the industry of 3D animation works. 
                I have previously worked in the retail and hospitality industry, at varying levels of management. This taught me how to work as a team, train and guide other staff members to get the desired result.
                In my free time, I enjoy staying fit and living a healthy lifestyle but also have a love for all things food-related, which include cooking and eating everything in sight. I love to travel and enjoy exploring new and fascinating places; I have an extensive wishlist of destinations which someday I hope to visit.
                I believe that no matter your current skill level, there is always room for growth and that if you have enough passion, there is nothing you cant learn. 
                I am eagerly waiting for an opportunity to break into the developer industry and canâ€™t wait to start progressing my skills and network with awesome people.
