## Purpose and Features

### My website has four seperate pages: home, about me, skills and contact.
1. The home page is the initail page you will visit and it displays a large logo/name to show to the viewer clearly whos website they are visiting and that I am a junior developer.
2. Secondly, we have the about me page. The purpose of this page is so that the viewer can to get to know me better. I have a photograph of myself and a short biography so they can get a glimpse of my personality and traits.

3. Next up is the skills page. This page has a list (accomanied by vectors) of all the different coding languages, frameworks and programs that I have varying levels of skills in.
4. The last page is the contact page. Here you can input whatever you want to email me about and send it off or you can click on any of the social media icons to visit me on those platforms. I also have a link to download my resume (at the moment nothing will download as I need to update my resume fully).

### On the mobile version:

-The home page has links to all of the other pages or clickable icons to my social network pages for easy navigation to where you want to go.

-On the other 3pages there is a clickable menu button at the top that brings down a drop down menu where you can navigate to any of the other pages.

## Target audience  

My websites target audience would be for potential employers or other developers looking to network or get in touch to possibly c.

## Planning Process/Development
- We were given 5 days to fully complete and deploy the project.
- I used trello to plan out my tasks as I went.
  ![Trello](personal_website/assets/images/readne_images/trello.png)
- For the first few days I used pinterest and professional illustrators websites to create a mood board to explore the different possible colors for my own creation.
![moodboard](personal_website/assets/images/readne_images/moodboard.png)

- Next I went on to creating a logo for myself, this started with rough sketches then eventually developed into a finished product using figma.

- Next was on to the design and layout of the site. I used trial and error to finally find a design I was happy with that suited my needs. This was until I realised some of the things I wanted to implement I would need Javascript for. So i went back onto figma and redesigned it so that I could use Soley CSS and HTML.

- After that It was on to coding, starting with the HTML, I made seperate files for each page and put all of the content needed onto it.

- Once all the HTML files were complete it was time to do the CSS, this is where I ran into some trouble, with my designs I needed to completely re-arrange certain parts, change the navigation bar and hide certain images/svgs for different media queries. I used CSS grid to format all the divs into the correct positions. One cool trick I found out for the navigation bar was to use a hidden checkbox over the 'MENU' text to drop down a menu.

- Unfortunately I was only able to fully create the website fully functional on mobile as I spent too much time on the design phase and got a bit too ambitious with my design considering my current skill level.  


### Short Answer Q & A  
  
Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words)  
  
> In the 80s there was a limited network called the Internet Protocol (IP) that allowed computers to communicate around the world. However, it was not like the internet is today and was mostly intended for data sharing between scientists. In 1991 Tim Burners-Lee invented the world wide web which was a network of information accessible to anyway with an internet connection. Web browsers with GUI only became available in 1992 and from there more GUI web browsers became available and made surfing the web popular.  
>
> Dial-up internet came about in the early 90s and information was transferred over telephone line (meaning either the phone or the internet were able to be used at one time). From there newer technologies such as broadband and fibre optics have been developed to further increase the speed of data transfer and number of users on a single connection at any one time.

Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words)

> Domains are names assigned to IP addresses so that people can navigate to them easily. However, it is only through using a DNS that we can search for websites in a web browser and reach the websites IP address (and therefore see the content on the website). 
> 
> Web servers contain the content of a website (including file types like HTML and CSS) so that we can view them in our browser.

Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words)
> The introduction of 4G mobile internet has transformed how we use the internet today. Prior to 4G we were limited mostly to relatively slow 3G connections or wired or short-distance wireless connections through WiFi.  
> 
> Given that we have now been able to cut the cord, it has opened up the opportunity for us to use the internet and phones where ever. This has meant the ability for apps like Google Maps and Uber are now possible and also commonplace.
