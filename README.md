## Purpose and Features

### My website has four separate pages: home, about me, skills and contact.
1. The homepage is the initial page you will visit and it displays a large logo/name to show to the viewer clearly whos website they are visiting and that I am a junior developer.
2. Secondly, we have the about me page. The purpose of this page is so that the viewer can to get to know me better. I have a photograph of myself and a short biography so they can get a glimpse of my personality and traits.

3. Next up is the skills page. This page has a list (accompanied by vectors) of all the different coding languages, frameworks and programs that I have varying levels of skills in.
4. The last page is the contact page. Here you can input whatever you want to email me about and send it off or you can click on any of the social media icons to visit me on those platforms. I also have a link to download my resume (at the moment nothing will download as I need to update my resume fully).

### On the mobile and tablet version:

-The home page has links to all of the other pages or clickable icons to my social network pages for easy navigation to where you want to go.

-On the other three pages, there is a clickable menu button at the top that brings down a drop-down menu where you can navigate to any of the other pages.

### Desktop version:
-Navigation is on the left-hand side, also featuring links to my other networking pages (this is displayed the same on every page)

-Incomplete with a few bugs.

## Target audience  

My websites target audience would be for potential employers or other developers looking to network or get in touch to possibly c.

## Planning Process/Development
- We were given 5 days to complete and deploy the project entirely.
- I used Trello to plan out my tasks as I went.

- For the first few days, I used Pinterest and professional illustrators websites to create a mood board to explore the different possible colors for my creation.

- Next, I went on to create a logo for myself; this started with rough sketches then eventually developed into a finished product using Figma.

- Next was on to the design and layout of the site. I used trial and error to finally find a model I was happy with that suited my needs. That was until I realised some of the things I wanted to implement would need Javascript. So I went back onto Figma and redesigned it so that I could use solely CSS and HTML.

- After that It was on to coding, starting with the HTML, I made separate files for each page and put all of the content needed onto it.

- Once all the HTML files were complete, it was time to do the CSS, and this is where I ran into some trouble, with the designs I needed to completely re-arrange certain parts, change the navigation bar and hide certain images/svgs for different media queries. I used CSS grid to format all the divs into the correct positions. One neat trick I found out for the navigation bar was to use a hidden checkbox over the 'MENU' text to drop down a menu.

- Unfortunately, I was only able to totally create the website fully functional on mobile and later the tablet (but not the same design as originally planned) as I spent too much time on the design phase and got a bit too ambitious with my design considering my current skill level. I also cut the projects page out as I don't have any content to put on that page as of yet. 


### Short Answer Q & A  
  
Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words)  
>In 1981, the Computer Science Network (CSNET) is established to provide networking services for university computer scientists.

>In 1983, Domain Name System (DNS) is created, this is a much easier system than trying to remember an IP address.

>In 1986, NSFNET goes online for supercomputer centers. The NSFNET was a network of networks that connected academic users along with the ARPANET.

>In 1990, a scientist by the name of Tim Berners-Lee,  developed the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), which we still use to this day. 

>In 1993, CERN releases the World Wide Web for the public domain with Dial-up internet.

>In 2005, Broadband connections surpass dial-up connections.

>Today, families have multiple devices in the household all connected to the internet. Continuously becoming a more dominant part of peoples lives.

1. Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers:

> Domains are names that are allocated to IP addresses so that a user can easily navigate to their desired IP address (to view a website) just by using these names instead of having to remember a bunch of numbers and periods to complete the same task.<br>
 A Domain Name Server(DNS) is comparable to the internet's version of a phone book; They translate all the domain names into IP addresses. Computers access websites based on IP addresses, not domain names so this is essential so that web servers can communicate with web browsers.<br>
A web server is a computer that stores and sends a website's data (this includes varying files types such as HTML, CSS, images, stylesheets) to web browsers.<br>
A web browser is a program that is used to access and view web pages (e.g., Google Chrome).

1. Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today:

> The increasing data speeds of mobile internet is continually helping us expand what is possible for the future. It has already helped us go from only being able to use our mobiles to view basic websites with terrible load times to essentially having a desktop in your pocket without limitations. We can use apps that direct us (google maps), video call people across the world or stream movies via Netflix while on a train. As 5G and future mobile services are released, we will be able to do more and more.
